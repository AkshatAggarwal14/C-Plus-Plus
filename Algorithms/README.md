Keep these things in mind when adding an algorith :

* The folder structure must remain as follows:
<pre>
Algorithms/
├─── Topic 1/
│       └─── Algorithm_Name.cpp     
└─── Topic 2/
</pre>

* Check if an algorithm is already present, before adding it.

* The name of added file must be the algorithm's name and it must added in the relevant folder(must be created if not already present).
